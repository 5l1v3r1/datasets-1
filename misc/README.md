This directory contains miscellaneous malware reports. The samples were collected by searching for reports generated by Anubis and ThreatExpert that analyzed the same piece of malware.

Each subdirectory (`anubis`, `threatexpert`) contains MAEC reports derived from the original [Anubis](https://anubis.iseclab.org/) and [ThreatExpert](http://threatexpert.com/) reports. The original reports are in the `originals` directory for each category. Conversions were performed by:

* Anubis to MAEC: https://github.com/MAECProject/anubis-to-maec
* ThreatExpert to MAEC: https://github.com/MAECProject/threatexpert-to-maec

Samples are named by the MD5 hash of the original malware, so reports named with the same hash were derived from the same malware sample. For example:

* `anubis/originals/0bab6936c4ac24257194472e1362d31e.xml` is an Anubis report
* `anubis/0bab6936c4ac24257194472e1362d31e_anubis_maec.xml` is the MAEC report devired from that Anubis report
* `threatexpert/originals/0bab6936c4ac24257194472e1362d31e_threatexpert.xml` is a ThreatExpert report
* `threatexpert/0bab6936c4ac24257194472e1362d31e_threatexpert_maec.xml` is the MAEC report devired from that ThreatExpert report
* Both the ThreatExpert and Anubis reports are based on some malware sample with the MD5 hash `0bab6936c4ac24257194472e1362d31e`
* The `_deduplicated` form of each report is the result of running the MAEC report through the MAEC deduplicator. The feature is experimental and is currently on python-maec's `deduplicator` branch at https://github.com/MAECProject/python-maec/blob/deduplicator/maec/utils/deduplicator.py
